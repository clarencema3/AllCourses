Sometimes, subsections may be needed for different operating systems or particularly complicated installations.
 

Usage
-----

This section explains the principles behind this README file.  If this repository were for actual _software_, this [Usage](#usage) section would explain more about how to run the software, what kind of output or behavior to expect, and so on.

### Basic operation

A suggested approach for using this example README file is as follows:

1. Copy the [source file](README.md) for this file to your repository and commit it to your version control system
2. Delete all the body text but keep the section headings
3. Write your README content
4. Commit the new text to your version control system
5. Update your README file as your software evolves

The first paragraph in the README file (under the title at the very top) should summarize your software in a concise fashion, preferably using no more than one or two sentences.

<p align="center"><img width="80%" src=".graphics/screenshot-top-paragraph.png"></p>

The space under the first paragraph and _before_ the [Table of Contents](#table-of-contents) is a good location for optional [badges](https://github.com/badges/shields), which are small visual tokens commonly used on GitHub repositories to communicate project status, dependencies, versions, DOIs, and other information.  The particular badges and colors you use depend on your project and personal tastes.

The [Introduction](#introduction) and [Usage](#usage) sections are described above.

In the [Known issues and limitations](#known-issues) section, summarize any notable issues and/or limitations of your software.  The [Getting help](#getting-help) section should inform readers of how they can contact you, or at least, how they can report problems they may encounter.  The [Contributing](#contributing) section is optional; if your repository is for a project that accepts open-source contributions, then this section is where you can explain to readers how they can go about making contributions.

The [License](#license) section should state any copyright asserted on the project materials as well as the terms of use of the software, files and other materials found in the project repository.  Finally, the [Authors and history](#authors-and-history) section should inform readers who the authors are; it is also a place where you can acknowledge other contributions to the work and the use of other people's software or tools.

### Additional options

Some projects need to communicate additional information to users and can benefit from additional sections in the README file.  It's difficult to give specific instructions &ndash; a lot depends on your software, your intended audience, etc.  Use your judgment and ask for feedback from users or colleagues to help figure out what else is worth explaining.
