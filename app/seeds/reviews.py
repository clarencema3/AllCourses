I had a 8:30am tee time and was playing in wet muddy grass (I slipped twice) plus the fog made it extremely hard to see where I was hitting.",

Course was in decent shape, but a lot of maintenance crews were out and about. The rough is unpleasant. Challenging, for sure, so read up on your golf tips before you arrive. Greens were very fun, and some real doozies in the mix."
